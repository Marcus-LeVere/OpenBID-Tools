# OpenBID-Tools

Create a new Apps Script in your OpenBID spreadsheet (extensions > Apps Acript) and paste in this code. Click the run button to authorize it. It will fail this first time, but this is fine. It just needs inputs from the spreadsheet to run.

You will now see =GPT and =DALLE functions in cells!
